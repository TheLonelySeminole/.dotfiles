#### A simple repository for my dotfiles. Nothing fancy

- Still on Arch and not going anywhere...

- Loving:
  - Hyprland
    - HyprPanel
    - Kitty
    - clipse for my clipboard
    - hyprpaper for background
    - Hyprlauncher for app launching
    - /usr/lib/polkit-kde-authentication-agent-1 for auth
  - LazyVim with a few tweaks for my editor
  
  - HyprPanel is really good for me. The GUI editor is cool, but more importantly
    it's functional and looks great. Digging it.
