#### A simple repository for my dotfiles. Nothing fancy

- I'm testing out a new Arch Linux setup
  - Hyprland
    - Kitty with the Lavandula theme and Fira Code font
    - Waybar is a work in progress... I'm liking my current config
    - clipse for my clipboard
    - hyprpaper for background
    - mako for notification
    - /usr/lib/polkit-kde-authentication-agent-1 for auth
  - My Neovim dotfiles. Just LazyVim with a few edits.
  - It ain't much, but it's honest work...
